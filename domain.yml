  - text: "Greetings, esteemed agent!
           You've been handpicked to join the ranks of our elite team at Platinum Breakout Industries Inc.,
           where our unparalleled expertise lies in orchestrating prison escapes for the world's most valuable inmates.
           Your reputation for cunning and resourcefulness precedes you, and we are confident that you'll make a significant contribution to our cause.
           Your first assignment involves assisting a high-profile client, James The Mastermind Maddox, who finds himself incarcerated in the infamous
           Blackstone Maximum Security Prison. A former ally of Platinum Breakout Industries Inc., James possesses invaluable information that could change
           the course of our operations. Unfortunately, his intricate plans went awry, and he's now serving a life sentence.
           Time is of the essence. We've managed to smuggle a state-of-the-art communication device to James, enabling you to 
           guide him remotely through a perilous series of escape room-style puzzles. These challenges have been specifically 
           designed to test the mettle of even the most seasoned escape artists.
           Prepare yourself for a race against the clock. You must navigate James through the bowels of Blackstone, overcoming treacherous
           obstacles and solving enigmatic riddles, all while evading the ever-watchful eyes of the prison guards. The fate of our client and our
           company's future endeavors rests on your capable shoulders.
           Remember, agent, failure is not an option. Good luck, and may fortune favor the bold!"
